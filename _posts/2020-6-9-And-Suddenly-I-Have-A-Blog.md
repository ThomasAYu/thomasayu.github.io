title: And suddenly I have a blog!
---

One thing I've learned so far in programming is that efficiency and reuse are very important. 

There's a reason that people build libraries of code and that the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle exists. Why spend time typing out the same section of code multiple times when a single method that encapsulates that functionality will not only save time but reduce noise and increase readability? Why spend hours writing code for functionality that already exists in our libraries? (Sometimes of course there are great reasons for doing this - when learning to code, for example. The point is to consider the benefits & costs.)

Reusing what others have made and having reuse in mind when writing our own code can help us and other programmers spend more time and energy on higher priority jobs.

This, of course, is just a fancy way of saying Barry Clark made a nice Jekyll theme and I created a fork of it to make this blog :D While I would be keen to learn more about designing and coding my own blog from scratch, now is not the time. Back to my projects I go!
